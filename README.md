Node.js HTTP router with out-of-the-box document-serving and session-keeping capabilities. Can use certain modules optionally for expanded capability, ensuring that your server is as fat or lean as you want.

Mandle is currently in an **UNSTABLE** state and will undergo some changes before its API is finalized.
